# Dropbot

Dropbot is a simple tool that allows you to easily sync things into Dropbox without any hassle.  Simply right-click the item, and sync it, right-click again, and unsync it.

## Symlink to Dropbox

This service allows you to right click any set of files or folders and choose "Symlink to Dropbox".  This will move the selected files/folders to ~/Dropbox/Dropbot and then place a symlink in the original location of the file.

## Unlink from Dropbox

This is the opposite to the above, if you right-click a Dropbot symlink you can select to unlink, which will remove the symlink and move the symlinked file/folder out of dropbox and into the location of the symlink.

## Installing

(In OSX) Simply open the workflow files and agree to install the services when prompted.  The options "Symlink to Dropbox" and "Unlink from Dropbox" will appear in the right-click/control-click menu when selecting files in the Finder.
